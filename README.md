# Boat-Timers
A program made for a local park, an improved version of their existing system for timing boat rentals

Simply this code uses tkinter to display 50 timers, all with the options to stop and start indervidually, the program uses colours as time decreses to ididcate the time left, this program was based off of the oe they already used at the park however they asked me if i could make a version that would not require interneta ccess to run, so I did.
